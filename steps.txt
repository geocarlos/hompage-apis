Dependencies:
One Possibility:
- Cognito: userId (cognitoUserId), phone?, e-mail? -> When account is created using Near Account, user should be confirmed automatically.
- DynamoDB: userId (partitionKey, from Cognito), accounts[]

Another Possibility:
- NearApps API handles authentication and provides authentication code or JWT token (?), which can be checked by an authorizer for AWS API Gateway
